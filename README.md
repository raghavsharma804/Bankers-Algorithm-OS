# OSproject
This is a Operating System project.
I have been assigned two questions.
  i.Write a multithreaded program in C that outputs prime numbers. 
  This program should work as follows: The user will run the program and will enter a number on the command line. 
   The program will then create a separate thread that outputs all the prime numbers less than or equal to the number entered by the user.
   24.	Consider following and Generate a solution in C to find whether the system is in safe state or not?
   Available	Processes	Allocation	Max
   A	B	C	D		           A	B	C	D  	A	B	C	D
              P0          1	5	2	0		0	0	1	2	0	0	1	2
	            P1	       1	0	0	0	1	7	5	0
	            P2	       1	3	5	4	2	3	5	6
	            P3	       0	6	3	2	0	6	5	2
	            P4	       0	0	1	4	0	6	5	6
